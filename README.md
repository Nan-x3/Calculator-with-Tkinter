# Calculator-with-Tkinter
**This is a calculator i am making using the Python module Tkinter.**
 
**This is still a W.I.P so i know most of the calculator isn't working. I am currently making the physical elements, alignment and other minor adjustments to make it look good.**

Currently:
1. has a 4x5 grid of buttons.
2. has a theme changer which can change upto 3 themes.
3. has all the numbers in the buttons and a 0 in the label for the basic calculator look.

What to expect:
1. A working simple calculator.
2. upto 6 interchangeable themes.
