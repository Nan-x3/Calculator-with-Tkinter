# Calculator-with-Tkinter
**This is a calculator i am making using the Python module Tkinter.**
 
**This is still a W.I.P**

Currently:
1. has a theme changing button which can change between 6 themes.
2. has a working calculator with 10 buttons for the digits (0-9), a decimal point (.), 4 operators (addition '+', subtraction '-', multiplication 'ร', and division 'รท'), a backspace button, a clear button.

What to expect:
1. a new button (still not decided what its use would be)
2. a better working calculator (Currently, you can write numbers like 0.0.1, which i don't want, so i'll be updating it soon after i find a way on how to)

Thanks for taking your time to read this, i hope you find the code useful or cool :>
